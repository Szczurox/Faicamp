This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) chat app with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)-based backend bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The project is still in development.

## Getting Started

Firstly, install all needed dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) this command should run automatically.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Firebase

This project uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for database, storage and user authentication.

Go to [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs) for more information.

### Getting Started with Firebase

To get Firebase up and running create a project by going to [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/).

Then create [Firestore Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) and [Cloud Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage).

After you are done go to the project settings, scroll down and copy firebase config.

Then you have 2 choices:

1. ðŸŸ¢ (Recommended) Create [.env.local](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) file with this structure

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=[apiKey]
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=[authDomain]
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=[projectId]
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=[storageBucket]
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=[messagingSenderId]
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=[appId]
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=[measurementId]
```

2. Go to [src/firebase-utils/clientApp.tsx](https://github.com/Szczurox/Faicamp/blob/main/src/firebase-utils/clientApp.ts) and paste the credentials into the clientCredentials object directly.

Currently Firestore and Storage rules are not included in the projects repo, if you want to create secure rules check out [Firestore security documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started)

## Deploy on Vercel

This project uses [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) for hosting.

Check out [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Side notes

- If you want you can deploy the app to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) or any other host instead of Vercel, it shouldn't affect performance.
  I chose Vercel because of simplicity and better integration with GitHub as well as Next.js.

- If you prefer [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) over [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) after creating `package-lock.json` you can remove `package.json` and use:

```bash
yarn import
```

&emsp;&ensp;&ensp;to create `yarn.lock` file from `package-lock.json`.
